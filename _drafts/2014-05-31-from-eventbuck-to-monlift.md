title: "From EventBuck to Monlift"
description: "EventBuck is one of the best project I have ever worked on. EventBuck helped me to learn most of the things I know today. I really believed this project could be something big. But now , I think it's time to move onto other things, to learn new stuffs and of course to discover new excitements.
That's why I have started a new side project, Monlift."

Almost a year ago, I decided to start a new website for people to share events happening on campus. I wanted to build a place where people would come together around events taking place on campus. I thought it was a cool idea. So I started building it right away. 
Then 3 great guys, <strong>Jake</strong>, <strong>Christophe</strong> and <strong>Jerome</strong> joined me along the way to build what would later become <a href="http://www.eventbuck.com">eventbuck.com</a>. 
I had a lot of fun building a project I believed in. I hope Jake, Christophe and Jerome had too. 
I learned so many things, I went from zero web development experience to building a website where close to 80 people registered. It was really a very nice experience.

<h3> So what went wrong then? </h3>
EventBuck was a great project. A lot of people told us they loved our website. But unfortunately we had a hard time getting the users back to our website after they first visited.
We wanted it to be social. We wanted people to connect around parties at school. But we couldn't just make them come back to the website as often as we wanted. So the website didn't really take off as we wanted.
We tried everything we could. We tried marketing and all the stuffs but he really just didn't take off. 
Because of that, I decided it is time for me to move on.

<h3>So what happens next? </h3>
EventBuck helped me learn a lot and also showed me that everything is possible, there's nothing impossible at all. But now I feel like I have to move on. I have to learn new stuffs and keep trying new things.
I will not shutdown eventbuck. People can keep using it if they want. I have open sourced it so people can learn from it, or even work on it to build something better if they want.

As for me, I am pursuing my internship at Wanted Technologies and I am discovering new stuffs every single day. Sometimes I hate that I can't travel and enjoy this summer properly. I hate that I am going to miss the World Cup in Brazil. But the fact that I am learning and improving myself everyday makes up for that.<br/>
And last but not least, I also started a new side project called <b>monlift</b>. Thanks to <strong>Antoine</strong>, who inspired me with this idea.
For now I can't really tell you more about the project though. 
But I promise, I will come back to tell you everything you need to know about it in a new post.<br/>
As for now, I wish you all well.
<br/>

<i>God bless you.</i>
