title: "What I learned from the CS GAMES"
description: "One of the most important quality I have always wanted to have in my life is the ability to find the positive aspect of every situations I find myself in. Last week I attended the CS GAMES. I was in the first of the two teams which represented our University at ETS in Montréal. It was really fun! I learned a lot of things as expected. I will share a few of them with you in this post."

From friday to sunday this week, I will be in Montréal for my first ever <a href="http://csgames.org/2014/"> Computer Science Games </a>. Every year, a different university organises this event which is open to all undergraduate students.This year, the École de technologie supérieur of Montréal will be our host.


In fact, I did not attend the last CS GAMES held at home, I just didn't feel like I was ready. You may think that now I feel like I am ready! Guess what? No, I don't! But what made me change my mind this time was that I just realized it's not just about the competition and the way we perform but it's about the fun of being there with those fellow ambitious undergraduates students, being able to learn from each other, to share what we know, to expand our networks, that's what makes the CS GAMES a fun place to be. I'm going there to have the utmost fun (remember the parties?) and also to try to learn everything I can from others there.

Nevertheless I didn't forget the competition DNA of the event(duh! who doesn't enjoy winning!). That is why I have been preparing since sunday. 
In fact, I will be running in 4 competions: The relay programming, the database challenges, the CSEC-corpo challenge and the web developpement challenges.
So far I have been preparing only for the database challenges because they are going to be theorical ( I hate theorical stuffs). Now I think I have to start digging into the <a href="http://www.playframework.com">play framework</a> which we will use for the web developpement challenges if I really want to come out with a trophy from this event.

For now though, I'm just really happy with the fact that I'm going to attend this event and I hope for you, especially if you are a computer science student here in Canada, to also start attending such events if you don't already do that. Meeting with people following the same goals always opens up our minds and we always learn something new from this kind of events. I will keep you updated about the event and the outcome.

Peace!
