I'm very excited to let you know that I'm starting blogging here.

It's almost a year since the day I decided I had to reach Silicon valley. Since that day, I worked so hard and my work has culmunated in my website <a href="http://www.eventbuck.com">Eventbuck</a>, a new part-time job at Laval University as a web developper and last but not least, an internship this summer at the best in the field of Business Intelligence for the Talent Marketplace, <a href="http://www.wantedanalytics.com"> Wanted Technologies </a>.

Now I think the time has come for me to give back what I have been given. 
This blog will be about everything I learn along the way. I will write about the technologies I'm interested in, the stuffs I learn , and above all the mistakes I make in order to help others to avoid them.

Hopefully you will enjoy it, and we will have a wondefull ride together.

-This is going to be fun!
