<p class="p1">From friday to sunday this week, I will be in Montréal for my first ever &lt;a href="http://csgames.org/2014/"&gt; Computer Science Games &lt;/a&gt;. Each year, a different university organizes this event which is open to all undergraduate students.This year, the École de technologie supérieur of Montréal will be our host.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">In fact, I did not attend the last cs games held at home i.e Université Laval, I just didn't feel like I was ready. You may think that now I feel like I am ready! Guess what? No, I still don't! But what made me change my mind this time is that I just realized the cs games is not just about winning the competition but it's really about the fun of being there with those fellow ambitious undergraduates students, being able to learn from each other, to share what we know, to expand our networks, etc. That's what makes the CS GAMES a fun place to be. I'm going there to have the utmost fun (remember the parties?) and also to try to learn everything I can from my fellow students.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Nevertheless I am not going to give up on the competition(duh! who doesn't enjoy winning!). That is why I have been preparing since sunday.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">In fact, I will be running in 4 competitions: The relay programming, the database challenges, the CSEC-corpo challenge and the web development challenges.</p>
<p class="p1">So far I have been preparing only for the database challenges because they are going to be theoretical ( I hate theoretical stuffs). But I think I definitely have to start digging into the &lt;a href="http://www.playframework.com"&gt;play framework&lt;/a&gt; too as we will be using it for the web development challenges.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">For now though, I'm just really happy with the fact that I'm going to attend this event and I wanted to share this moment with you. I encouraged other undergrads, especially those from Université Laval to start attending such events if they are not already doing that. These kinds of events are always great place to learn new things and also to connect with other students from the same area of interest. So I greatly encourage students to participate in such events.</p>
<p class="p1">As for me,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I will keep you updated about the event and all the new things I will discover there.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Peace!</p>
